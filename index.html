        fact: "The Universe is Expanding",
        description: "The universe has been expanding since the Big Bang, approximately 13.8 billion years ago. This expansion is accelerating due to dark energy, a mysterious force that makes up about 68% of the universe."
      },
      {
        fact: "There are More Stars Than Grains of Sand on Earth",
        description: "Estimates suggest there are about 200 billion trillion (2 x 10²³) stars in the observable universe, far outnumbering the grains of sand on all Earth’s beaches."
      },
      {
        fact: "Black Holes Can Slow Down Time",
        description: "Near the event horizon of a black hole, the gravitational pull is so strong that time dilation occurs, making time move slower compared to regions far from the black hole."
      },
      {
        fact: "The Universe is Transparent",
        description: "For the first 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe was opaque due to high-energy photons scattering off electrons. It became transparent when it cooled enough for atoms to form, allowing light to travel freely."
      },
      {
        fact: "There’s a Giant Cloud of Alcohol in Space",
        description: "Sagittarius B2, a massive molecular cloud near the Milky Way’s center, contains enough alcohol to fill 400 trillion trillion pints of beer. However, it’s not drinkable as it’s mostly methanol."
      },
      {
        fact: "There’s a Cold Spot in the Universe",
        description: "The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation has a mysterious cold spot, which is much cooler than expected. Some theories suggest it might be caused by a supervoid or even other universes."
      },
      {
        fact: "The Most Powerful Explosion Ever Observed",
        description: "Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic explosions in the universe, releasing as much energy in seconds as our Sun will over its entire 10-billion-year lifetime."
      },
      {
        fact: "Galaxies Can Collide",
        description: "Our Milky Way is on a collision course with the Andromeda Galaxy, set to merge in about 4.5 billion years. This event will form a new galaxy, often referred to as 'Milkomeda.'"
      },
      {
        fact: "Neutron Stars are Mind-Bogglingly Dense",
        description: "A sugar-cube-sized piece of neutron star material weighs about a billion tons, as it is packed with the remnants of collapsed stars."
      },
      {
        fact: "The Universe is Mostly Empty",
        description: "Only about 5% of the universe is made up of ordinary matter (atoms). The rest is dark matter (27%) and dark energy (68%), which we cannot directly observe but infer through their gravitational effects."
